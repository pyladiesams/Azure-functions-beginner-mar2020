# Plan of the workshop

## Why should you attend this workshop?
A quick search online for learning material about Azure Functions will leave you swimming in documentation, online courses, and a lot of other resources. 
From my experience, the majority of these either assumed you knew too much about the topic already, or they gave high-level or background information 
without helping me understand how to actually implement something using Azure Functions.

* How to properly structure your Python code.
